	<summary>FREE EDUCATION FOR POOR PEOPLE</summary>
	<div>
<p style="color: red;">Today we can see a large number of street children, beg and scavenge through stinking garbage piles to eke out a living .For these street children, an education is the farthest thing from their minds. Yet it is education that is their best hope of living with dignity and respect. Hence as a part of this project, we encourage all our sponsors/ volunteers to come forward and join hands for this initiation. We believe that our contribution towards this noble cause will not help these children directly but also serve our nation and ultimately the mankind as a whole.
